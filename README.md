# Final_Project

Our App Scion is changing the way intended parents (ip) look for gestational carriers (gc). 

This is a full stack MERN applicaiton thatuses semantic UI, a authentication system build by the team, and an algorithim to help connect the IPs and GCs.

We currently are having some issues with heroku deployment, however please feel free to explore our code base to get a sense of how the app works. 

*The app will work on your local machine!
