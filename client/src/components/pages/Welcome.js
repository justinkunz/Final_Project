          Welcome to Scion! It is our mission to help connect intended parents,
          and gestational carriers together in an attempt to assist those who
          are having difficulties bringing life into this world. Through our
          application we make the difficult, opaque process of finding suitable
          candidates not only more efficient, but transparent for both of the
          primary parties involved. We focus on the key attributes from each
          party that will ultimately facilitate this process, which, in turn
          will lead to more successful results from artificial insemination. Our
          app is currently in its infancy, but we are diligently working on
          rolling out a more complete experience that will further assist
          individuals navigate the tumultuous legal, psychological, and payment
          regulations which govern the act of creating life through artificial
          insemination.
